# Cryptocurreny prediction using LSTM network

Project is designed to work as pipeline to easy works with various datasets and can be configurable as needed.

**Pipeline's main phases are:**
* Source - Scrapping data 
* Operation - Preparing data
* Execution - LSTM network lifecycle (building, training and verifying model)

### **Dependencies**

To run project use **Python 3.7 (64-bit version)**

Other main libraries: 

* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Tensorflow
* Keras
* Scikit-learn
